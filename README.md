# HaskellThanLight

HaskellThanLight is an imitation of the game FTL: Faster Than Light by Subset Games, written in Haskell. In our simplified imitation of the game, you command a ship in a combat scenario. You can move your crew members from room to room, and you can damage the enemy ship by clicking your weapon box, then clicking the enemy ship.
